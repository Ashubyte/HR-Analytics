HR analytics, also known as people analytics, workforce analytics, or talent analytics, involves collecting and analyzing Human Resources (HR) data to improve an organization's workforce performance. It helps HR departments make data-driven decisions by providing insights into various aspects of employee management. Here are some key components and benefits of HR analytics:

Key Components of HR Analytics

Data Analysis: Using statistical and analytical tools to process and analyze the collected data. This can include descriptive analytics (what happened), diagnostic analytics (why it happened), predictive analytics (what will happen), and prescriptive analytics (what should be done).

Key Metrics: Common metrics analyzed in HR analytics include employee turnover rates, time-to-hire, cost-per-hire, employee engagement scores, training effectiveness, and absenteeism rates.

Tools and Software: Utilizing specialized software and tools like HRIS (Human Resource Information Systems), ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems), and analytics platforms such as SAP SuccessFactors, Workday, and Tableau.
